Recent years, the digital textbook--a digital eBook intended to service as the text for a class, is very hot in colleges and universities. Most college students choose to rent the digital textbook on line instead of purchasing the traditional printed textbook. Why? Because it is more convenient to carry around everywhere and costs less. If you are lucky enough, you can even get the free etextbook on line. Since going to the colleague is expensive, why not save the money and spend it on where it is needed mostly? As there are so many resources online, it is difficult for you to figure out which site you should go to get the digital etextbook. Today, I will share a list of best websites to get free etextbooks and rent etextbooks.
