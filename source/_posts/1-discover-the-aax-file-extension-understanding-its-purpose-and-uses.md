[Free trial?](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 6/14/2019 3:27:54 AM 

I was looking to test the epubor product by converting an .aax file to mp3\. It only converted 10 minutes, which is understandable under a free trial basis. However, I need to know how it will parse a 10 hour audio book .aax. Will it break it up into 10 minute segments? Will it break it up into chapters as audible does? What??

I have just updated my Epubor Audible to v1.0.11.218\. I can now no longer drag and drop .aax files into the work space - the file icon shows a red barred circle. The version I was using immediately before updating 1.0.11.173 did not have this problem.

 What has gone wrong and how do I fix it, please?

[Duration .aax to .mp3?](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 5/26/2024 1:05:02 AM 

Hi,

 I have just purchased the Audible Converter for Apple. I converted an audiobook around 500 MB, which took me over 3 hours. I converted it to MP3\. Now I am converting another audiobook. I am converting to MP4\. It does not feel faster.

 Is this the expected time to convert an audiobook or is it only me experiencing such a long time to convert one?

 Thanks, Zack
