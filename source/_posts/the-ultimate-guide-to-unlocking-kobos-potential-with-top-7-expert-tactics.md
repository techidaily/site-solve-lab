### How to read Kindle books on Kobo

Imaging you find an interesting book which is only available on Amazon, thus you purchased it on Amazon and want to transfer it to your favorite Kobo eReader, but it didn't recognize it at all. Why I cannot read downloaded books on my favorite eReader? Actually, Amazon uses its own unique eBook formats which are not supported by Kobo. It's annoying for our Kobo fans, right? But don't worry, I have found an easy way to make Kindle books readable on Kobo.

Now that we have figured out that eBook format is the reason that prevents us reading Kindle books on Kobo, the only step is to convert Kindle files to Kobo supported format, PDF or EPUB. Here I recommend you a powerful software[Ultimate eBook Converter--Epubor Ultimate](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/), which has both **DRM decryption and eBook conversion** features. With this tool, we can convert Kindle books to Kobo with ease, no matter there are **DRM free or DRM protected**.

[](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/) [](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/) 

As the image shows, it supports batch conversion and decryption. Only 4 simple steps are needed.

1. Launch the software
2. Drag Kindle files from right side to the main interface of the program(automatically detect and upload your Kindle files)
3. Select "EPUB" , "PDF" or specific Kobo eReader as output format
4. Tap "Convert" button to start conversion(output folder will pop up automatically when the conversion finished)

### How to add Kindle bookerly font to Kobo

Last year, Kindle just released its new font called bookerly. This is a huge improvment on Kindle reading experience. It has solved the problem with text justification, kerning, drop caps, image positioning and more.But it's only supported by limited device. So how can we add Kindle bookerly font to Kobo?

![add kindle bookerly font to kobo](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/add-kindle-bookerly-font-to-kobo.jpg)

1. Download [Bookerly file](http://forum.xda-developers.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=3137426&d=1422419182)and unzip it
2. Connect Kobo to computer with USB
3. Open Kobo drive and create a new folder "fonts" (if none exists)
4. Copy all of the files in "Bookerly" folder to fonts folder
5. Eject your Kobo and wait it finishes processing.
6. Turn off and back on

When you open a book on your Kobo, now you can see the new font via font menu. Enjoy!

### How to **request a Kobo price match**

Kobo has provided us a eBook price match system, I guess many users may have not been aware of it. If you come from US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, or the UK and purchased an eBook from Kobo, but later you found the same one on another website with lower price, you can ask Kobo to credit you the difference, plus 10% of your original purchase price.

**Precondition of requesting a price match:**

1\. You have to file your claim within 7 days of purchasing it and the eBook has to have the same ISBN number.

2\. The eBook store that is offering a cheaper price must be in domestic. For examply, you cannot buy something from the UK Kobo store and say the US price is cheaper.

**How to request a Kobo price match?**

1. Enter the the details page of any eBooks on Kobo.com, tap "Price Match Guarantee".
2. Click "Start Your Request"
3. Enter your information under "Your Details".
4. Under "Competitor Information", input the URL where you found the eBook with lower price, as well as its price.
5. Click "Submit".

Kobo will verify the competing offer and you may get reply within 3 business days.

### How to tell if a Kobo book has DRM before purchasing it

I guess many users may criticism DRMed books, as we cannot do anything we like on them. Though we paid for them, it seems they are not 100% owned by us. But luckily, not all the books from Kobo eBook store are DRM protected. Then, how can we get DRM free eBooks? According to my experience, the best way is to tell if a Kobo has DRM before purchasing it. 

Simply click the cover of the books you like, then you will enter the page of eBook details. At the bottom of this page, you can see DRM-free or Adobe-DRM word under "eBook Details" item. Obviously, we can clearly know the books are DRM free or DRM protected from this message.

I used the trick you describe to add the Bookerly font to my Kobo Aura One. The files for Italic, Bold, and Italic Bold are useless, But the file for Bookerly Regular works fine.

 Question: I would like to add the Amazon Ember Bold font to my Kobo Aura One. Where can I download it?
