## Top Review of Plugable Portable Tablet Stand PT-STAND1: A Revolving Desk Accessory Perfect for Cooking Enthusiasts

### Key Takeaways

* The Plugable PT-STAND1 is a simple yet functional tablet stand with a 360-degree rotating base for versatile use.
* It is compatible with devices ranging from 12.9-inch iPads to phones, making it a useful accessory.
* Minor drawbacks include a potentially annoying clicking sound when swiveled and a large logo that may be distracting for some users.

 The [Plugable PT-STAND1](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CNTTD22V?maas=maas%5Fadg%5F5E6F57563270DFBE3EA4D1C4B4D863A1%5Fafap%5Fabs&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2002484&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fplugable-pt-stand1-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Authority) isn’t fancy or overly clever, but it does rotate 360 degrees which makes it handy to use in a lot of places. It can work for a 12.9-inch iPad down to smaller phones so it can be useful, no matter what device you need held up.

 The main feature is that this stand can occupy a minimal footprint and still raise up or down and twist in a complete circle. It works great. The other features are more minimal but still neat.

 There’s a cutout along the bottom for a power cord. In the back is a hole for more cable management so a cord doesn’t get stuck when it’s rotating.

 There are two hinge parts for lots of different angles, including 180 degrees of flexibility. The rubber backing used was soft to the touch and minimal. It also didn’t seem like it would be peeling anytime soon.

 The stand weighs 14.6 ounces, or just under a pound, which makes it feel sturdy. There was no doubt that it could hold all the devices I used it to prop up. And yet, it wasn’t overly heavy so it was a piece of cake to move around the house.

 I do have some minor nitpicks about the stand too.

 Every time the stand swivels it makes a clicking sound. Is there a technical reason that needs to happen? I’m not sure, but I could have done without it. It won’t be a big deal in a lot of situations, but it could be annoying in a quiet house at night or other obscure situations.

![Plugable PT-STAND1 showing a big Plugable logo on the base](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/03/universal-tablet-stand-rotation.jpg)

 There’s a giant Plugable logo that didn’t need to be there. Even if you can get over the constant advertisement, the white logo on dark metal can give the illusion of the swivel stand being off-center or crooked. There was no reason this logo shouldn’t have been on the bottom—or not there at all.

##  Should You Buy the Plugable PT-STAND1?

 The convenience of the [Plugable PT-STAND1](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CNTTD22V?maas=maas%5Fadg%5F5E6F57563270DFBE3EA4D1C4B4D863A1%5Fafap%5Fabs&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2002484&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fplugable-pt-stand1-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Authority) makes it a winner. Of course, I wish it didn’t have a giant “Plugable” logo (complete with USB-A connector).

 The 360-degree rotation is the premier feature, while its stiff, solid frame makes it feel incredibly durable. Unless you need a magnetic connection or under-cabinet mounting option, this stand should work for most tablets and it’s a perfect addition to a kitchen counter where you might be shifting around frequently.
