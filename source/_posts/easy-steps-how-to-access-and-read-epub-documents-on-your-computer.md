### Open Non-DRM EPUB Files on PC Online

#### [1\. Play Books](https://play.google.com/books)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

#### 2\. Simple Epub Reader

 You can also upload ebooks to it without creating an account. Uploading ebooks to Simple Epub Reader from URLs and the local computer hard drive. Simple Epub Reader will display your books in a rather clean and visual way. Then you can click on the book you want to read to open it and begin reading.

After the book is opened, it will look like this:

![open epub on pc](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/open-epub-on-pc.jpg)

#### [3\. MagicScroll eBook Reader](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/magicscroll-web-reader/ecldhagehndokdmaiaigoaecbmbnmfkc?hl=en)

MagicScroll eBook Reader?can be used to read epub files, but it won’t look pretty in the interface. Usually there is one ad on Simple Epub Reader's library page, while there are three on MagicScroll's page. The interface doesn't look so clean. But that doesn't matter so much, as it works well when you open books to read.

![magicscroll ebook reader](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/magicscroll-ebook-reader.jpg)

### Open Non-DRM EPUB Files on PC with Free Software

#### [1.Calibre](http://calibre-ebook.com/download)

You can click to download it if you don't have Calibre in your computer. Calibre can be used to read non-DRM epub files. Just click the "Add" icon to add your epub books to it and click the book to open it.

If the book is DRMed, you cannot open it and will see this window:

![drmed book](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/drmed-book-files.jpg)

 And so you cannot open DRM epub files with Calibre or the following free softwares. The non-DRM epub books will be opened normally.

#### [2\. EPUB File Reader](http://www.epubfilereader.com/)

EPUB File Reader is a free epub files viewer. It can help you to open and read DRM-free epub ebooks and documents. The software interface consists of two parts, the left will show document chapter directory and the right is a browser to show document content. I think this is better for us to read the books compared with other softwares. This software is very easy to use. It is also completely free. Through the "File" menu, you can "Open" and "Close" a EPUB file (file extension is .epub).

![open epub files software](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/open-epub-files-software.jpg)

#### [3\. Stanza Desktop](http://stanza-desktop.en.softonic.com/download#downloading)

It can be used to read all kinds of digital publications, including electronic books, newspapers, PDFs, and general web content.

Pros: Very elegant; Lots of customizable features; Supports a wide range of formats.

Cons: A little bloated

#### [4\. FB Reader](http://fbreader.en.softonic.com/)

FB Reader is a free?and?open source?ebook reader?for Microsoft Windows, GNU/Linux, and other platforms. Supported formats include ePub, TXT, Fiction Book, TCR, RTF, CHM, OEB, HTML, Mobipocket(mobi) etc. without DRM and plain-text. I have tried it to read my epub files, too. It's OK.

#### [5\. Ultra eBook Reader](http://www.ultraebookreader.com/)

![ultra ebook reader](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/ultra-ebook-reader.jpg)Ultra eBook Reader provides you the ability to read eBooks, comics, PDF, and document files directly on your PC. Ultra eBook Reader provides support for 12 of the most popular eBook and document file formats including: EPUB, PDF, MOBI, and CBR.

Ultra eBook Reader turns your existing PC into a reading device by providing support for popular eBook and document formats. You can take advantage of a flexible layout and zoom configurations to enhance your reading experience. So it's also a good reader to open and read epub files for you.

#### [6\. Sumatra PDF](http://blog.kowalczyk.info/software/sumatrapdf/free-pdf-reader.html)

Sumatra PDF?is an ebook reader for Windows. The ebook formats it supports including ePub, PDF, MOBI, CBZ, CBR, CHM, XPS, ect. It is small, portable, and starts up very fast. And the simplicity of the user interface has a high priority over othes. For myself, I like Sumatra PDF very much, I feel really comfortable when reading with it.

### Open DRM EPUB Files on PC 

Many times you may find that epub books are locked by DRM. Most of them are in Adobe DRM or Nook DRM. How to open them?

#### **1\. Open Adobe DRM epub files on pc**

For epub files with Adobe DRM, you can open and read them in Adobe Digital Editions, Nook for pc, Kobo for pc etc. these official desktop softwares. 

#### **2\. Open Nook DRM epub files on pc**

For epub files with Nook DRM, you can open them in Nook for pc.

#### **3\. The best way to open any DRM epub files on pc**

You can see that DRM epub files only can be opened in certain e-readers. It's a bothering thing to download so many different reader applications to your computer and read certain books with certain e-readers, right? Besides, the DRMed epub files cannot be copied or transfered. Do you want to fix this like me? I dont't like to download so many softwares in my computer. I hate the reading limitations. I want my reading experience is totally free, with any reader software I like, and no restriction of my books. If you feel the same with me. Just follow my steps.

**Step 1**.**Get the tool downloaded.**

 After you remove the epub books' DRM, you can read these books on whatever software or device as long as it supports epub. And you can transfer and share the books with your friends and family members, they can also read successfully if the books become DRM free. Here I strongly recommend[Epubor All DRM Removal--Epubor Ultimate](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/). You can download it now for free trial. 

[](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/) [](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/) 

**Step 2**. **Remove DRM.**

Install the program and run it on your computer. It will automatically find your ebooks, and they will be listed in the book column in the left part of the program interface. Just drag them to the right part, their DRM will be removed within seconds.

If you have other epub books that are not displayed in the right part book column, you can directly drag and drop them to the main interface of the program. Their DRM will also be removed immediately.

I was trying to erase the stars - it didn't work. Everything I read had to do with reading my books on my PC. I assume that means Personal Computer. I'm 83\. I don't want to sit at my desktop PC and read a book. I've been trying for hours to load the books I bought onto my iPad Nook reader. None of it works and I finally got sent here.

 Crap. What kind of hoops does everyone expect me to jump through? I'm 83 and I have trouble walking, let alone trying to jump!

 Why is this so difficult? When I get my regular books on Nook, I look at Freebooksy; tap on the bar that says "NOOK" and voila! my book appears on my iPad Nook.

 Now that I've paid for the rest of the series, there is NO way (so it seems) to get them on my iPad.

 What do I need to do? My back is sore from sitting at this desktop and trying.

 Anyone there with a compassionate heart and a lot of patience who can help me?

 Hopefully yours,
