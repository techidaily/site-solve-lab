## Pros & Cons of QuickTime

QuickTime doesn't do many tasks as other programs do. But it does allow you to do many things that the other programs don't. Here we list the both sides.

### Pros of QuickTime：

* Works great with HD videos. Working great with HD and Full-HD videos is another secret of its popularity. You can experience pristine video quality of any movies or videos.
* Audio playback integration. It also offers integration with your browser so you can watch videos right from its window without the need to save the content to disk.

### Cons of QuickTime:

* Many extra codecs are needed for playback. Through it performs well during audio and video playback, you have to install codecs manually.
* Installs bloatware. Like most Apple softwares, QuickTime needs to install additional tools, also known as bloatware. As a matter of fact, this is just eating extra space on the disk as many systems has already equipped with similar ones. This also causes other follow-up problems such as software update and application support.
* Doesn't support some common video formats. The biggest disadvantage is that Quicktime player doesn't support some popular video formats, like WMV, AVI, MKV, DivX and etc. You have to convert the videos in those formats first.

### QuickTime Alternative

As discussed above, although QT gets the job done well in many asepcts, its codecs and built-in features are a little limited and not enough to meet many users' needs. In these cases, you can turn to other Quicktime alternatives which can do the same tasks.
