Hi,

 I just wanted to try your converter for an ebook I uploaded from Amazon via Kindle for PC (Version 1.24 as you were suggesting).

 Best regards

[how can the KWX encryption be cracked?](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 5/1/2023 6:30:39 PM 

Hello,  
 I can't convert different books from Amazone because the ad KWX appears. Is there a version of Epubor ultimate that cracks KWX encryption?  
 I have Epubor Ultimate 3.0.10 330 installed on my machine.  
 I have an old version of the Kindle for PC installed on my computer. However, for the books with KWX encryption, I get the message that I should update to a new version. I haven't had any trouble converting in the past, only recently. I can't fall back on a download via USB either, since the  
 Books cannot be purchased but borrowed through Kindle Unlimited.  
 could you help me further?  
 Best regards

[Converting to M4B combines small chapters](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 3/31/2023 9:01:54 AM 

When converting an AAX file to M4B, the output file combines shorter chapters together. I don't know exactly what the limit point is, but many times the acknowledgements get rolled in with the first chapter, and section names (which are generally about 3 seconds long) also get combined in to their following chapter. The structure of the ebook makes it desireable to still have these as separate entries, so currently I have to go through and manually update the chapter lists to split these back out. Is there a way to change the settings to prevent this combining?
