## 1\. iTunes vs MacX MediaTrans: Interface Design 

 Apple claims to optimize iTunes with simpler interface. However, that doesn't really help. iTunes has more features added for you to not only organize your music, video, photos, iBooks, etc., but also buy TV shows, movies, apps and more thereon. That results in an unfocused, unituitive and confusing tool. No wonder almost every iTunes users complain a lot about **iTunes horrible interface**. And some radical users even asks Apple to do their a favor to kill the complicated iTunes.

Yet, what really depresses you is the unchanged confusing iTunes after all these years (18 years after its release). So instead of waiting for its change, a better solution is to apply a **user-friendly** iPhone manager software. MacX is up to the mark.

## 4\. iTunes vs MacX MediaTrans: Data Backup 

It would always be better to make an iPhone backup as Plan B than no backup lest your iPhone is stolen or file data accidently gets lost. However, when it comes to use iTunes to backup your iPhone, there's high likelihood for you to be trapped into these troubles:

* iTunes cannot backup iPhone \[XXX\] because an error occurred or [iTunes backup couldn't be completed](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/).
* iTunes won't let me selectively backup my iPhone.
* Why does iTunes take a long time to backup my iPhone? My iPhone is taking forever to backup.
* The latest updated version of iTunes doesn't allow you to backup iTunes to another computer if your desktop fails unless you have purchased all the music from Apple.

iTunes could not backup the iPhone

As for majority of iTunes users, iTunes seems still in its infancy after all these years. See, one of the top complaints about [iTunes errors](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/)is still alive and those features it oughts to develop still have nothing to do with it. Under such conditions, there is little you can do to make iTunes work smoothly or let it do what it can't do. Instead, you can count on **best iTunes alternative** from MacX because whatever demands you have can be well satisfied.

* Powered by the advanced Unison, Syncany and other file backup algorithms, it can easily backup your iPhone contents (music, video, pictures, iTunes encrypted purchases, iBooks, ringtones...) to macOS and Windows, smooth as butter.
* Maximize the flexibility to let you freely select what you want to backup, the entire files or selective files.
* **World's No.1 fast speed**  to sync and [backup iPhone contents to Mac without iTunes](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) at 5X faster speed than any other tools, thanks to Intel QSV/Nvidia (NVENC/NVDEC)/AMD GPU hardware acceleration tech. Thus, it, at most, takes you **1/5** of the iTunes time to finish the whole iPhone backup task, 80% of your time being saved!

## 5\. MacX vs iTunes: File Management

More often than not, we entitle iTunes as an iPhone manager than an iPhone backup tool partly because its commercial slogan is "iTunes is the easiest way to organize and enjoy the music, movies, TV shows, apps, and books you already have. Yet, we can't sugarcoat the truth that iTunes leaves too much to be desired. The headachy iTunes errors during iPhone file management never comes to an end...

* Music genres are wrong in iTunes Match on iOS.
* iPhone song shows different artist than in iTunes.
* iTunes won't let me edit song info and I can't delete music from iOS device in iTunes.
* I cannot delete photos from "Synced from iTunes Library".
* iTunes is messing up music and playlist. It costs me much time to organize music into playlist and adjust the settings to prevent my iPhone from automatically syncing with iTunes lest some of songs randomly get missing.

Google each iTunes problem and try the time-consuming solutions one by one? Or you can give the one-stop solution a whirl to tackle all these iTunes music/photos management problems at one stroke. Check what [MacX MediaTrans](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) can do for you.

● **Manage Music Songs:** let you edit and manage your iPhone songs without any ado, e.g., modify artist/album/composer/year, batch edit songs info, create new music playlist, manage songs via artist/album categories, delete unwanted songs, turn songs into iPhone ringtones, [convert M4P to MP3](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), etc. Just click it and it goes well very, no risks on your beloved iPhone songs being removed by iTunes library sync after changing iTunes setting to "Manually manage music and videos" to fix [iTunes not working problem](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/).

## 6\. iTunes vs MacX MediaTrans: Charges

Not a single iTunes user complained about Apple charges within iTunes. They often receive an alert that their cards are charged over 29.99/60 dollars to iTunes for no purchase or fault of theirs. The moment they get such messages, they contact Apple support and are told, "We are sorry that was done in error and we will refund this within 10 days.". Yes, they do refund your money, but it causes some overdraft fees for your credit card 10 days later. 

iTunes' wrong charge won't happen with its best alternative MacX. You can use MacX trial version for 100% free, or enjoy its full features without limits after purchase. It only charges you once and won't bother you with any operational error.

## 7\. iTunes vs MediaTrans: The Usage of iTunes Purchases

It's understandable that you're refused to access to the iTunes purchased files if you don't buy them. But what if you've already purchased them? You can freely use them? Not really, actually.

According to iTunes users' feedbacks, they are automatically declined to watch any of their previously purchased TV shows, just due to a payment failure of a TV show. They feel so angry because they can't enjoy their legal and reasonable rights. Plus, they have no way to get their money back. 

Now with the best iTunes alternative **MacX MediaTrans**, you can transfer and **backup your iTunes purchases to Mac or Windows**  first lest the accident happens. This application is able to painlessly backup iTunes purchases (movies, TV shows, music, podcast, audiobooks, iBooks...) from iPhone to Mac/PC and to let you remove DRM from iTunes purchases during sync. Thus, your iTunes purchases can be auto converted from [M4V to MP4](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), M4P to MP3 for your personal legal enjoyment. What's more, you have no need to bear the consequences of TV shows rejection caused by iTunes payment failure error.
