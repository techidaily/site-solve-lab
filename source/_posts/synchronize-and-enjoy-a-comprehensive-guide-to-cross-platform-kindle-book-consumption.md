If you also wonder to know if we can read kindle books on other devices, this post may be just what you are looking for.

With your own amazon account, reading kindle books on one kindle device is very easy. so here I will introduce you **2 ways to read kindle books on multiple devices**. 

### Method 1: Install free kindle reading app

This way is suitable for you if you want to read kindle books on other tablets or smart phones. Such as, read kindle books on iPad, iPod, iPhone, Nexus 7, Nook tablet, Kobo Arc, etc.

And this is also a feasible solution to read kindle books on pc / mac, make sure you can read kindle books on computer.

### Method 2: Make your Kindle books convertible

If you want to read kindle books on other eReaders, such as Kobo glo, Sony eReader, Nook Simple Touch, etc, for you can't install apps on e-ink readers, so we must make our books convertible and transferable to Kindle.

Here are steps for you about how to make kindle books convertible. At first let me tell you the reason **why we have to convert kindle books**.

* Kindle books are with DRM protection
* Kindle books are with Kindle format, not common epub or pdf

The DRM problem is one of the obstacles that prevent us reading kindle books on any other devices. And , as you know, non-Kindle devices, such as Kobo, Nook, iPad, and so on, their common ebook formats are EPUB and PDF. So we need a tool to help us strip drm from kindle and convert kindle to pdf or epub. You can search the Internet to find a good tool, here I write my suggestion [Epubor Ultimate](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/).
