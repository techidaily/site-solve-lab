Hi Everyone, I've got a Kindle question I'm hoping someone can help with. I use the Kindle for PC app (Australia) to download books I buy so I can back them up. I have cleared the 'automatic update' box, but this morning it still updated without my permission. It will now not let me downgrade, and no matter which version of the app I download, when it is installed it is the current version 1.30\. I'm using Windows 10\.   
 I'm stuck, any suggestions?
