**What are the video formats supported by QuickTime?** You can rip DVDs to one of QuickTime formats: QuickTime Movie (.mov), MPEG-4 (.mp4, .m4v), MPEG-1, 3GPP, 3GPP2, AVI, and DV. Quicktime has limited H.264 support (not all profiles, no 10 bit, chapters & subtitle need special meta data...) and older QuickTime don't support H.264.

**Step 3\. Select Audio/Subtitle Tracks**

Back on the home screen, you can click on the selected DVD title to select a subtitle or audio track you would like to play on QuickTime. For example, you can change the default "Disabled Subtitle" to Track1 English, Track2 French or forced subtitle... If your desired subtitle track is not included in the DVD disc, go to Google to download the subtitle track and click the Edit button on the selected title to add external .srt subtitles and apply other editing.
