### Solution 1: Check Network Connection 

 The first thing that you should think of is your network connection. Open a webpage on your browser to see if it works. Afterwards, connect to the iTunes Store.

1\. If your computer is unable to connect to network, turn off Wi-Fi connection and re-start your Wi-Fi router several minutes later.

2\. There is no problem with Wi-Fi connection but the error message still shows up when you connect to iTunes Store. Dig out effective solutions to possible iTunes errors (1671, -50, -23, -1...).

3\. In case your iTunes Store can be opened but it displays a blank white page, change to a stronger Wi-Fi network or identify & remove layered service provider software.

**Step 1:** Unplug your iPhone from your Mac/Windows computer.

**Step 2:** Make sure you have a stable Wi-Fi network connection. You're not suggested to use cellular data or personal hotpot, cuz they're not strong enough or stable. Then, open your iPhone and enable Wi-Fi thereon.
