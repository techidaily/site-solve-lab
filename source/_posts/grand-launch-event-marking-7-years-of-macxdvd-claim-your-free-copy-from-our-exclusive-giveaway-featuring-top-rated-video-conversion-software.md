"Since our first media helper introduced seven years ago, we have earned an energetic response among users, with over 98% having happy experience with MacXDVD solution," said Jack Han, CEO of MacXDVD Software, "Now MacXDVD continues to stay ahead on pundit charts like Softonic in video converting, DVD ripping, iPhone management and more. One of the constants throughout the past seven years is always our customer. There is no better way than offering our most popular [HD video converter](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) to those who accompany us as we grow to commemorate this anniversary."

[MacX Video Converter Pro](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), a professional video converting software which has hit a total of over 5000K downloads globally, is focused on converting the video file you want to watch into the format you need to watch it. It has a full library of media codecs covering over 200 simple and familiar formats like MP4, MOV, AVI, 3GP, MKV and more. Masses of users have used it to convert incompatible videos from camcorder, video editing software, websites and other sources for iPhone 7/7 Plus, iPhone 6S/SE, iPad Pro/Air 2/mini 4, Android etc. in one click. 

Its pioneering support for Intel's QSV hardware acceleration tech gives it a massive leg up on its competition. Compared with others, it will reduce the video converting time by up to 80%-90%. For instance, while other converters typically take more than 5 minutes to convert a 4K [HEVC video to h.264](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), the same task is cut to 1 minute with MacX Video Converter Pro. This speed sets a new benchmark that knocks almost all the competitors out especially in an era where videos are having crisper and sharper images.
