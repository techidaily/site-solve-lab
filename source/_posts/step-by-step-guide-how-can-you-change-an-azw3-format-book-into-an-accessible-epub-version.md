To start this guide how to convert AZW3 to EPUB, for good understanding I would settle it with several parts including what's azw3 file, why we have to convert azw3 to epub, how to, etc. So it would be better to read them step by step.

Of course if you had get a good knowledge about the AZW3 format, you can pass those parts of the supplementary instructions and go straight to[how to convert azw3 to epub](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/).

### Part 1: What is AZW3

If you were Kindle ebook's loyal fans, you won't feel strange to the AZW3 format. And there are also a large number of people prefer to call AZW3 as KF8 (Kindle Format 8). At the beginning ![what's azw3 file](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/what-is-azw3.jpg)AZW3 was just used on Kindle Fire only, and many people don't take special attention to it.

 But, I didn't know exactly when, the AZW3 format expanded to Kindle Paperwhite and be widely used on the E-Ink eReader. What's more, if you synced your books with Kindle for PC/Mac, some of them would be turned to .azw3 file from .azw after the DRM removed. This is a very interesting phenomenon, yes?

Perhaps we can even predict that AZW3 format would play a big role on Kindle ebook world in the near future. But as the saying goes every coin has two sides, we may usually meet some obstacles to read kindle azw3 books, too. This is what I want to say in Part 2.

### Part 2: Why we convert azw3 file to epub

As I have written at part 1, AZW3 file is well supported on Kindle Paperwhite. But, on computer or other tablets and smart phones, how to open an azw3 file? The common way is using the free Kindle reading apps.

However, tha fact we couldn't escape is, on non-Kindle devices, such as Kobo, Sony, Nook, Nexus 7, iPad, and so on, books we read are not only from Kindle store but also from another ebookstore. So we prefer to the built-in or another third-party reading apps rather than Kindle app.

Though maybe there are still a part of people love Kindle app, but as this app only supports kindle ebooks, so if we want to read Apple books, we need iBooks app; if we want to read kobo books, we need Kobo app...Oh my god, our devices may become too "fat" to run smoothly.

![drm-in-azw3-file](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/kindle-azw3-drm.jpg) But, we can't open and read AZW3 format ebooks directly without Kindle app. The reasons are as below.

<a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082538/7443" target="_top" id="2082538"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082538" border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082538/7443" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
**DRM problem:** most of the books we downloaded on Kindle Paperwhite are protected with Kindle DRM, which prevents us coping, transferring, and sharing kindle ebooks.

**Format problem:** most of the third-party reading apps on non-Kindle devices only support the EPUB and PDF format, not the AZW3.

So here comes the need of converting azw3 to epub and pdf.

To remove Kindle drm limitation, input your KSN (Kindle Serial Number) for successful drm removal at the pop-up window. Don't know how to find the proper KSN? Don't worry, you can read the full guide on [How to Easily Find the Kindle Serial Number](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)
