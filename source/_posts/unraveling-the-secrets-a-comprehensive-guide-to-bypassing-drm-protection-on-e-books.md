If you are an eBook fan, I guess you may usually purchase eBooks online. But the fact that most of our purchased books are DRM protected, this limite us to read books only on eBook retailers' specific device or app. We cannot share eBooks between different devices, or share our favorite books with best friends. Though we have paid for them, it seems they are not 100% owned by us. It's really a pain for eBook lovers, right? So, in order to enjoy eBooks more freely, removing DRM is the best way. In this article, I will tell you how to unlock DRM books for details.

#### **Get the tool ready**

Before we unlock DRM books, we have to prepare the DRM Removal tool first. Currently, there are many DRM Removal software on the market, we may don't know which one is better. Here I strongly recommend a powerful program [Ultimate eBook Converter--Epubor Ultimate](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/) for you. It's the best DRM Removal + eBook Converter. We can use the tool to decrypt DRMed books from the main eBook retailers, such as Google, Sony, Kobo, Barnes & Noble and Amazon Kindle. It supports batch decryption. We can unlock a lot of DRM books at a time within a few seconds. I can say it's the best DRM Removal tool as far as I am concerned. You can download it for free trial. Next, I will teach you how to unlock DRM books with this software.

As the image below shows, there is a very user-friendly design for us. The “Kindle”, "Adobe", "Nook", "Kobo" icon are on the left side of it, which means books from different retailers will automatically show up under the different icon. What's better, it will help automatically detect our Kindle and Kobo eReaders after connected to computer. This is very clear and convenient for us to handle our eBook.

### Unlock DRM from Kindle books

As one of the biggest eBook retailers, Amazon is popular among many eBook fans. Because it usually provides us wider species of eBooks with lower price than other retailers. But it's obvious that most of Amazon books are protected by Kindle DRM. To enjoy your downloaded Kindle books as you like, now, let's learn how to unlock DRM from Kindle books.

**Remove Kindle DRM**

To remove Kindle DRM from [Kindle for PC/Mac](https://www.amazon.com/gp/digital/fiona/kcp-landing-page), we have to make sure we can read Kindle books on our computer. Once we run this software, we can see "Kindle" icon in the right side, just directly drag automatically uploaded Kindle books from the right panel to the left frame of the software to unlock Kindle DRM.

To remove Kindle DRM from Kindle e-Ink Reader, it's more easier to handle. We only need to connect our Kindle device to computer with USB. Then we can see our Kindle device show up in the right panel, just drag existing books to the main interface of this software. Then all the books will be decrypted soon.

### Unlock DRM from Adobe EPUB/PDF books

Most of books on the market are using Adobe DRM, such as Kobo, Nook, Google, Sony and other online eBook providers. To remove Adobe DRM, the first thing we have to do is to install [ADE](http://www.adobe.com/solutions/ebook/digital-editions/download.html)on our computer, then authorize it with our Adobe account which is used to purchase the EPUB/PDF books.
