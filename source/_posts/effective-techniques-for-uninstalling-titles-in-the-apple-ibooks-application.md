### Delete Purchased Books in iBooks

If you try to delete the purchased books in iBooks, you can also follow the above method, but when you press on Delete, it will only allow you to **_Remove Download_** like the following picture. You will still see this book is still in your iBooks with a Cloud icon at the top right corner with a download arrow. According to Apple’s policy, you are not allowed to delete the books in cloud and you are able to redownload the purchase books anytime you want by pressing the book cover.

#### How to hide iCloud books in iBooks?

Some people will feel uncomfortable when the iBooks has been deleted but still displayed in iBooks. By the restriction of Apple’s policy, it is not easy for us to delete them completely from iBooks. Here is another alternative way to solve your problem—hiding them.

Step 1: Tap **_All Books_**, you will find the option **_Hide iCloud Books_** at the bottom of the drop-down list. 

 Step 2: Enable this function **_Hide iCloud Books_** and all books in cloud will be disappeared from your iBook bookshelf.

#### How to delete books from purchased history?

As we known that the book purchased through iBook store will stay in your purchase history for as long as they are available to download. Even if we have deleted the purchased books from iBooks bookshelf, the purchase history will still be there. This is really annoying some time. I will show you how to hide the purchase history.

Step 1: Launch iBook on Mac. Enter your Apple account information. The windows user will not find this option because the iTunes has forbidden the iBooks functions in it.

![purchased ibooks](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/ibooks-purchased.png)

Step 2: Click on **_Purchased_** under the **_Quick link_** tab. You will see all your purchased books. When you move your mouse to one book, you can see a little X at the top right corner of the book. Click on “X”, a window will pop up and ask if you want to hide the purchase. Click on **_Hide_** button, the book will disappear from your purchase history.

Tap “Show All Purchases” and set it to off. Now exit iBooks app and launch it again on the iPad. It will no longer show the purchased books you have deleted but are still available to download

 I'm not showing this option on my iPhone 6\. Is there another way to permanently erase free book samples?

You can "hide" purchases by logging into your iTunes account, and "hiding" purchases, but then they still show on your iPad with the Cloud symbol. But you don't have to hide all purchases. Just swipe the title to the left, and you can delete it so it doesn't show with your other purchases.

Apple now has Rhapsody as an app, which is a great start, but it is currently hampered by the inability to store locally on your iPod, and has a dismal 64kbps bit rate. If this changes, then it will somewhat negate this advantage for the Zune, but the 10 songs per month will still be a big plus in Zune Pass' favor.
