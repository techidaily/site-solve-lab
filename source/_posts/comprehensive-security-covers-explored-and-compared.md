Does your audible converter software also covert Chirp audiobooks to mp3?

[Problems using KCR converter.](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 11/6/2019 7:42:05 AM 

Long time user of Epubor ultimate. Since Kindle 1.24 stopped working after upgrade to Catalina, moved to KCR converter. But have noticed that Kindle books converted to epub using KCR are slow. And also have low quality covers. Is there any way to just de-drm using KCR and then convert them to epub using ultimate? 

[Is it okay to convert a file to ePub that doesn't say nodrm?](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 6/18/2016 6:51:36 PM 

Hi, I'm using the trial version of your software. I've tried to convert a Kindle book I bought, but it's acted differently from the other one I just covered to ePub. When I put it into the list of files in the Ultimate window, it doesn't tick or say "decrypted". However, if I then convert it to ePub, it works. The files appear to both still contain the Kindle serial number. Will this cause me a problem with Kindle if I then view it on my reader on my Samsung phone?

 These are the filenames: bookname\_B00WJT3D8Q.azw3 (after import), and bookname\_B00WJT3D8Q.epub (after conversion  
).

[Epubor KCR not working with Kindle Cloud Reader](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/reader/) \-- 8/2/2020 2:26:30 AM 

I can't get Epubor KCR to work with Kindle Cloud Reader now. It looks like Amazon removed the ability to download kindle books. There is no button for downloads and nothing happens when I right-click the book cover in Kindle Cloud Reader. When I open a book, it doesn't download because epubor KCR doesn't see any books. Can this be made to work? Epubor KCR only works with Kindle Cloud Reader. I am using Chrome.

[where is the cover](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 9/12/2019 7:17:03 PM 

there is no cover after converting the files. do I have to import all books into calibre and look for the metadata there?

[metadata changes is not successful please check the books](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 10/18/2020 4:34:11 PM 

metadata changes is not successful please check the books. What does this imply and to resolve it.  
 I am trying to edit the metadata of a pdf file i.e replace the cover but get this error. Also why to remove the default epubor default cover image ?

[Replace with default Cover](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 11/18/2020 1:19:43 AM 

I have some e-books that I have decrypted and converted that do not have covers that show the title. Instead they have an image designed to represent a tablet. Others have a generic cover, that seems to build a cover that shows the title and author (default cover?). 

 How can I replace the first with the second?

 Thank you

[What are limitation of the trial version?](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 7/26/2021 12:19:30 AM 

I attempted to test a conversion of a Kindle eBook to PDF and of the 496 pages, only 25 pages converted and that did not include the cover. Are there limitations to the trial version? I really want to make sure this program is going to convert all pages before determine if it's worth purchasing.

[Why mobi books don't show cover](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 7/25/2018 3:55:21 PM 

I convert an ePub to Mobi and then email the mobi to my Kindle Paperwhite. It won't show up the cover.

[If I don't want to replace the cover, can I disable it?](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 4/11/2019 12:49:43 PM 

I hope the contents of the ebook are the same before and after the conversion.

[Cover graphic distorted](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 5/31/2020 6:43:59 AM 

I am converting from Adobe ascm to a pdf. Conversion is perfect except for the cover graphic which is somewhat pixelated. I see that there is an option to replace the cover but the cover looks correct there.

[Licence key not sent and cannot be recovered](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 7/18/2020 2:18:35 AM 

I ordered a license for audible convertor (\*\*\*\*09416) and you have not supplied the licence. On your website I have requested that you resend the licence 6 times. I have raised two support tickets and several chats and emailed support and you have not responded to any of my attempts to contact you. Please either send the key within the next two hours or refund the payment. Thank you.

[Free trial makes "only text" ePUB correct?](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 7/27/2022 3:31:34 PM 

Hi,

 I have installed the free trail and converted an Adobe DE ePub. It turns out just flat text without pictures / book cover etcetra. Is this correct? Is this due to the free trial, or is this "just what it is"?

 Thx!

[Corrupted conversion](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 11/30/2019 7:38:52 PM 

I brought a licence so I can fully convert an Kindle book into a PDF, however when I do this the output is corrupted. All I now get is the front cover and all the text is randomly scattered throughout the pages.

 When I only had a trail version it did convert it properly but only the first 60 pages.

 Why is it now not working?
