## How to Shrink Video for Instagram with High Quality 

Actually, if you have a video that meets all the requirements for Insta except in higher resolution like iPhone 4K video, you'll find it looks blurry since Instagram will shrink the file and lower the quality in the background as soon as you upload it. In order to keep the excellent quality of your video, you need a software to compress video for Instagram uploading. 

[**MacX Video Converter Pro**](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) is featured to compress and process videos for Instagram, involving various ways: 

* Change large footprint format to [Instagram video format](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), like MKV to MP4, MTS to MOV, and transcode video to H.264, VP9 from HEVC, MPEG4 etc.
* Downscale video resolution to 640p from 720p/1080p and even 4K without losing quality, lower bitrate to 3500kbps and reduce frame rate to 29.96fps.
* Trim the length of video to make it no more than 60 seconds, and crop the pixel dimension to finally reduce the video file size for Instagram.

Better yet, this Instagram HD video shrinker processes and compresses MP4 video in an incredible fast speed but highest quality reserved in the efforts of multi-core utility, Hyper-threading tech and High-Quality engine.
