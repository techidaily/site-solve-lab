So to upload a HD video to Instagram, the first thing comes to process and compress videos for Instagram, which is not confined to reducing the video file size, but also changing the format/codec, adjusting resolution, frame rate, bit rate etc., and editing videos. It means that is essential to grab a Instagram video compressor to make HD video available for Instagram.

* Bitrate: No limit to bitrate file if you're using two pass encoding, as long as your video doesn't exceed 1GB. Otherwise 8 megabits per second for 1080p and 4 megabits per second for 720p.
* Aspect ratio: Landscape (1.91:1), Square (1:1), Vertical (4:5). 1:1 Square video at 1080×1080 pixels is commonly used.

## How to Shrink Video for Instagram with High Quality 

Actually, if you have a video that meets all the requirements for Insta except in higher resolution like iPhone 4K video, you'll find it looks blurry since Instagram will shrink the file and lower the quality in the background as soon as you upload it. In order to keep the excellent quality of your video, you need a software to compress video for Instagram uploading. 

[**MacX Video Converter Pro**](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) is featured to compress and process videos for Instagram, involving various ways: 

* Change large footprint format to [Instagram video format](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), like MKV to MP4, MTS to MOV, and transcode video to H.264, VP9 from HEVC, MPEG4 etc.
* Downscale video resolution to 640p from 720p/1080p and even 4K without losing quality, lower bitrate to 3500kbps and reduce frame rate to 29.96fps.
* Trim the length of video to make it no more than 60 seconds, and crop the pixel dimension to finally reduce the video file size for Instagram.

Better yet, this Instagram HD video shrinker processes and compresses MP4 video in an incredible fast speed but highest quality reserved in the efforts of multi-core utility, Hyper-threading tech and High-Quality engine. If you happen to have a i5 or i7 processor on Macs with Intel QSV hardware acceleration built in or a hardware accelerated graphic card like Nvidia GeForce, AMD Radeon™ HD 7000 Series or better, MacX will speed up the Instagram video size reduction up to 5 times faster.
